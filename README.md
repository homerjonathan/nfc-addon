libnfc and libfreefare - Mifare Classic Library Addon For Node.js

Addon for Node.js giving proper access to the libnfc and libfreefare libraries within Node.js rather then using the spawn command and reading the results to a file and reading it in.  So a much smoother result.  

Run node-gyp build to compile the Node Module.
